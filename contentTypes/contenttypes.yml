# This file defines the contenttypes on the website. See the documentation for
# details: https://docs.bolt.cm/contenttypes/intro

# Pages can be used for the more 'static' pages on your site. Things like
# 'about us', 'contact' or a 'disclaimer'. This content-type has a 'templateselect'
# field, which allows you to override the record_template setting for an
# individual page.
# The taxonomy for this ContentType is defined as 'groups', which is a so-called
# "grouping taxonomy". This way you can easily group sets of pages that logically
# belong together. If your site has a 'services' section, in which you'd like to
# list the different types of services a company provides, you can group these
# together.

# Entries can be used for things like 'news' or 'blogpostings'. They have a 'teaser',
# which can be used for a short blurb on listing-pages, allowing visitors to
# click-through to the rest of the entry. It also has fields for an image and an
# optional video.
# A relation is defined to the pages ContentType. This way you can refer to a page
# from your news-item.
# This ContentType defines 'categories' and 'tags' as taxonomies, allowing the
# editor to use both to categorize a specific entry.
# The 'sort' is set to '-datepublish', which means that newer entries will be
# shown above older entries.

# The 'Blocks' ContentType is a so-called 'resource ContentType'. This means

# text, an 'our address' in the footer, or similar short blurbs of text.
